# Hi, I’m Nirmaan

I like understanding how things *actually* work.
Not just getting them to run — but knowing why they behave the way they do, where they fail, and how they hold up when conditions aren’t ideal.

I’m building my foundation in **AI and Machine Learning** with an engineering mindset: careful where it matters, honest about gaps, and deliberate about progress. This GitHub is where that process lives.



## How I approach engineering

* I try to understand the problem before touching the solution
* I value clear reasoning over clever tricks
* I build small, break things, and rebuild with better judgment

I don’t believe good engineers are defined by how many tools they know — but by how they think when things don’t go as planned.



## What I’m working on

* Applying Machine Learning to real, imperfect problems
* Exploring how GenAI fits into usable systems, not just demos
* Learning and applying AI and ML

I’m early in the journey, but serious about depth and fundamentals.



## Stack (used with intent)

* **Languages:** Python, C
* **ML / Data:** NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn
* **Math for ML:** Linear algebra, probability, statistics (actively strengthening)
* **Engineering:** Git, GitHub, Linux
* **Practices:** readable code, reproducibility, documenting decisions

I prefer building fluency in fundamentals before expanding the stack.



## About the pinned repositories

The repositories pinned below are not meant to impress at a glance.
They’re meant to be read.

Each one reflects how I think through a problem:

* what I was trying to solve
* the assumptions I made
* what worked, what didn’t, and why
* what I’d change if I were starting again

If a project didn’t teach me something meaningful, it doesn’t stay here.



## How I measure progress

* Cleaner structure than the last project
* Better questions than the last iteration
* Consistent improvement, not rushed output

I’m optimizing for long-term growth, not short-term noise.



## Let’s connect

* LinkedIn: linked on my profile
* GitHub: you’re already here

Still learning. Still building. Doing it properly.
